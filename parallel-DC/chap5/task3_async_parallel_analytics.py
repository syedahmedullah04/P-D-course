# CHAP 5 - TASK 3 - ADDED
# ============================================================================
# Program: E-Commerce Order Analytics System - Parallel Task Execution
# Description: Demonstrates asyncio.Task to execute three analytics functions
#              in parallel - simulating real-time e-commerce data processing
#              for sales, customer activity, and inventory analysis.

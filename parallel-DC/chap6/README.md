# Chapter 6: Distributed Computing with Celery and Pyro4

## Overview
This chapter demonstrates two powerful approaches to distributed computing in Python:
1. **Celery** - Distributed task queue for asynchronous job processing
2. **Pyro4** - Python Remote Objects for distributed object communication

Both frameworks enable parallel processing across multiple machines and processes, making them essential tools for scalable application development.

## Part 1: Celery Distributed Task Queue

### What is Celery?
Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing. It enables applications to distribute work across multiple worker processes or machines, making it ideal for:
- Background task processing
- Scheduled job execution
- Distributed computation
- Load balancing across workers

### Files
- **addTask.py** - Defines the Celery application and task
- **runAddTask.py** - Executes the task asynchronously

### Setup Instructions

#### Step 1: Start RabbitMQ Server
```bash
rabbitmq-server
```

#### Step 2: Start Celery Worker
Open a terminal and navigate to the `chap6` directory:
```bash
celery -A addTask worker --loglevel=info --pool=solo
```

**Note**: On Windows, use `--pool=solo` to avoid multiprocessing issues.

#### Step 3: Run the Task
Open another terminal and run:
```bash
python runAddTask.py
```

### Expected Output

**Terminal 1 (Celery Worker):**
```
-------------- celery@hostname v5.x.x
--- ***** -----
-- ******* ----
- *** --- * ---
- ** ---------- [config]
- ** ---------- .> app:         addTask:0x...
- ** ---------- .> transport:   amqp://guest:**@localhost:5672//
- ** ---------- .> results:     disabled://
- *** --- * --- .> concurrency: 1 (solo)
-- ******* ----
--- ***** -----

[tasks]
  . addTask.add

[2026-01-01 00:00:00,000: INFO/MainProcess] Connected to amqp://guest:**@localhost:5672//
[2026-01-01 00:00:00,000: INFO/MainProcess] celery@hostname ready.
[2026-01-01 00:00:05,000: INFO/MainProcess] Task addTask.add[task-id] received
[2026-01-01 00:00:05,000: INFO/MainProcess] Task addTask.add[task-id] succeeded in 0.001s: 10
```

**Terminal 2 (Task Execution):**
```
Task ID: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
Task Status: SUCCESS
Task Result: 10
```

### How It Works
1. **addTask.py** creates a Celery application and defines an `add` task
2. The Celery worker connects to RabbitMQ and waits for tasks
3. **runAddTask.py** sends the task to the queue using `delay()` method
4. The worker picks up the task, executes it, and returns the result
5. The client retrieves the result using `get()` method

## Part 2: Pyro4 Remote Procedure Calls

### What is Pyro4?
Pyro4 (Python Remote Objects) enables transparent communication between Python objects across different processes or machines. It allows you to call methods on remote objects as if they were local, making distributed computing intuitive and Pythonic.

### Key Features
- Transparent remote method invocation
- Name server for object discovery
- Support for callbacks and bidirectional communication
- Automatic serialization of Python objects

### Files
- **pyro_server.py** - Server hosting the remote object
- **pyro_client.py** - Client accessing the remote object

### Setup Instructions

#### Step 1: Start Pyro4 Name Server
Open a terminal:
```bash
python -m Pyro4.naming
```

#### Step 2: Start the Pyro4 Server
Open another terminal and navigate to `chap6`:
```bash
python pyro_server.py
```

#### Step 3: Run the Client
Open another terminal and run:
```bash
python pyro_client.py
```

### Expected Output

**Terminal 1 (Name Server):**
```
Not starting broadcast server for localhost.
NS running on localhost:9090 (127.0.0.1)
Warning: HMAC key not set. Anyone can connect to this server!
URI = PYRO:Pyro.NameServer@localhost:9090
```

**Terminal 2 (Server):**
```
Ready. Object uri = PYRO:obj_xxxxx@localhost:xxxx
```

**Terminal 3 (Client):**
```
What is your name? John
Hi welcome John
```

### How It Works
1. The **Name Server** acts as a directory service for remote objects
2. **pyro_server.py** registers the `Server` object with the name server
3. The server object exposes the `welcomeMessage` method using `@Pyro4.expose`
4. **pyro_client.py** looks up the server using `PYRONAME:server`
5. The client calls the remote method transparently
6. The server processes the request and returns the response

## Conclusions

### Celery - Distributed Task Queue
**Strengths:**
- Excellent for background job processing and asynchronous tasks
- Built-in support for task scheduling and periodic tasks
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Horizontal scalability with multiple workers
- Supports various message brokers (RabbitMQ, Redis, etc.)

**Use Cases:**
- Email sending and notification systems
- Data processing pipelines
- Scheduled report generation
- Image/video processing
- Web scraping and data collection
- Long-running computations

**Key Takeaway:** Celery is ideal when you need to offload time-consuming tasks from your main application and process them asynchronously across distributed workers.

### Pyro4 - Python Remote Objects
**Strengths:**
- Transparent remote method invocation (feels like local code)
- Easy to implement and understand
- Name server for service discovery
- Bidirectional communication support
- Pure Python implementation

**Use Cases:**
- Distributed computing systems
- Microservices architecture
- Remote monitoring and control systems
- Distributed data processing
- Client-server applications
- Multi-process coordination

**Key Takeaway:** Pyro4 excels when you need to distribute Python objects across a network and call their methods remotely while maintaining the simplicity of local object interaction.

### Comparison

| Feature | Celery | Pyro4 |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Primary Use** | Asynchronous task queue | Remote method invocation |
| **Communication** | Message-based (via broker) | Direct object-to-object |
| **Complexity** | Higher setup complexity | Simple and straightforward |
| **Scalability** | Excellent (multiple workers) | Good (multiple servers) |
| **Task Persistence** | Yes (via broker) | No (in-memory) |
| **Scheduling** | Built-in support | Manual implementation |
| **Best For** | Background jobs | Distributed objects |

---

### Final Thoughts
Both Celery and Pyro4 are powerful tools for distributed computing in Python:

- Choose **Celery** when you need a robust task queue with persistence, scheduling, and multiple workers processing jobs asynchronously.

- Choose **Pyro4** when you need to expose Python objects remotely and want transparent method invocation across a network.

In many real-world applications, these technologies can be combined: use Celery for background task processing and Pyro4 for inter-service communication in microservices architectures.
